              How to Choose a Pendant
            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3 sm:mb-4">
              When selecting silver pendant necklaces for women from Ahmedabad, comfort, styling needs, and personal choice must be taken into account.
            </p>
            <div className="space-y-3 sm:space-y-4">
              <div>
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 text-base sm:text-lg mb-2">Chain Length</h3>
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The length of the chain is significant in how the pendant looks when worn. Short chains give a contemporary, neat look, while a longer chain is more relaxed and has a gentle look. This is mainly decided from the style of the outfit and the preferred neckline. Consider where you want the pendant to sit and how it complements your clothing choices.
                </p>

              <div>
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 text-base sm:text-lg mb-2">Pendant Type</h3>
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The type of pendant should correspond with your routine and activities. Simple and subtle designs are more appropriate for daily use, while patterned artworks are more refined and can be perfect for gifting or pendants for the occasion. Choose based on whether you want an everyday piece or something for special events.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 text-base sm:text-lg mb-2">Daily vs Occasion Wear</h3>
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Another thing to think about is daily wear and occasion wear. Lightweight pendants with smooth finishes are ideal for daily use, providing comfort throughout the day. More intricate ones that showcase artistry bring a statement to the outfit for a more elegant look for special occasions. Consider your lifestyle and how often you'll wear the pendant when making your selection.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 text-base sm:text-lg mb-2">Comfort Priority</h3>
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Comfort should always take priority. A pendant that is well balanced is one that is lightweight and has a smooth finish, giving a neck that is not rigid or tense, perfectly complementing the outfit. Ensure the pendant feels natural when worn and doesn't interfere with your daily activities.
