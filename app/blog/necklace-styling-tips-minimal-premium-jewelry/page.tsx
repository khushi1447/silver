            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Minimal jewelry has become a powerful style statement for women who value elegance over excess. A well
              chosen necklace can elevate an outfit without overpowering it, adding quiet confidence and refined charm.
              For women who prefer premium quality with subtle design, necklace styling is all about balance, intention,
              and versatility.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              This guide explores practical and stylish ways to wear necklaces that feel luxurious yet understated,
              helping you create looks that are timeless, modern, and effortlessly chic.

          <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8 animate-fade-in">
            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
              1. Understand the beauty of minimal design
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Minimal necklaces focus on clean lines, smooth finishes, and thoughtful detailing. Instead of bold patterns
              or heavy embellishments, they rely on craftsmanship and material quality to stand out. When styling such
              pieces, the goal is to let the necklace complement your look rather than dominate it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              A single elegant necklace can often say more than multiple layers of loud accessories. Choose pieces that
              feel light on the skin but visually refined. This approach works especially well for women who appreciate
              jewelry that transitions easily from day to night.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
              2. Match the necklace with your neckline
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              One of the most important styling tips is pairing the necklace with the right neckline. This ensures
              harmony between your outfit and your jewelry.
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-4">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-gray-900">V neck tops</strong> pair beautifully with simple drop or curved
                designs that follow the natural line of the neckline.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-gray-900">Round neck outfits</strong> work well with short and delicate chains
                that sit just above the fabric line.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-gray-900">High neck or boat neck styles</strong> look elegant with slightly
                longer necklaces that add length and balance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-gray-900">Deep neck or off shoulder outfits</strong> allow minimal necklaces to
                shine without competing for attention.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              When the necklace aligns naturally with your neckline, the overall look feels intentional and polished.

          <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8 animate-fade-in">
            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
              3. Focus on quality over quantity
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Premium jewelry is defined by material, finish, and durability. Instead of rotating many pieces, invest in
              a few high quality necklaces that you can style in multiple ways. A well made necklace retains its shine,
              holds its shape, and feels comfortable throughout the day.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Minimal necklaces often become signature pieces. Wearing the same elegant necklace across different
              outfits builds a personal style identity that feels confident and refined.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
              4. Layering the minimal way
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Layering does not have to be bold to be effective. For women who prefer subtle luxury, layering should
              feel soft and balanced.
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-4">
              <li>Use two or three necklaces with slight length differences.</li>
              <li>Keep designs simple and cohesive.</li>
              <li>Avoid mixing too many textures or finishes.</li>
              <li>Let one necklace remain the focal point while others support it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              This creates depth without clutter, making the look sophisticated rather than busy.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Section 5 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8 animate-fade-in">
            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">5. Styling for everyday wear</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Minimal necklaces are perfect for daily wear because they are lightweight and versatile. Whether you are
              heading to work, meeting friends, or running errands, a simple necklace adds a finished touch to your
              outfit.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Pair a clean chain design with cotton kurtas, casual shirts, or simple dresses. Neutral colors such as
              white, beige, black, or pastel shades allow the necklace to stand out subtly. The goal is to look put
              together without appearing overdressed.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Section 6 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8 animate-fade-in">
            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
              6. Elevating formal and festive outfits
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Premium minimal necklaces also work beautifully with formal and festive attire. Instead of heavy jewelry,
              a refined necklace can balance rich fabrics and intricate clothing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              For sarees, lehengas, or evening gowns, choose necklaces with fine detailing or a small central element.
              This keeps the look elegant and modern while still feeling special. When the outfit is detailed, let the
              necklace stay simple. When the outfit is plain, allow the necklace to add gentle character.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Section 7 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8 animate-fade-in">
            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">7. Choosing the right length</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Necklace length plays a key role in how premium jewelry is perceived. Shorter lengths often feel classic
              and clean, while mid length designs add grace and versatility.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Short necklaces highlight the collarbone and suit minimal styling preferences. Medium lengths work well for
              layering or standalone wear. Choosing the right length helps maintain balance and ensures the necklace
              enhances your natural features.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Section 8 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8 animate-fade-in">
            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
              8. Keep other accessories minimal
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              When wearing a premium necklace, avoid overwhelming the look with too many accessories. Let the necklace
              be the hero.
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-4">
              <li>Choose small earrings or studs.</li>
              <li>Opt for subtle rings or bracelets.</li>
              <li>Avoid heavy or noisy accessories that distract attention.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              This approach highlights the elegance of minimal jewelry and keeps your overall appearance refined.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Section 9 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8 animate-fade-in">
            <h2 className="font-playfair text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
              9. Care and confidence complete the look
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A premium necklace deserves proper care. Clean it regularly, store it separately, and handle it gently.
              Well maintained jewelry always looks more elegant.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Most importantly, wear your necklace with confidence. Minimal jewelry reflects a strong sense of self and
              personal taste. When you feel comfortable and confident, even the simplest necklace looks extraordinary.
            </p>
          </div>
